### Database

For our final group project, we are analyzing crime rates in Austin while also looking at housing market trends and displacement risk. We have created a provisional database in csv file format that we sourced from the City of Austin open data portal. This database contains over 2.9 million rows of data. We also sourced the Austin housing market data (37 rows of data) and a 2019 displacement risk dataset also from the City of Austin open data portal (3007 rows).

Austin Police Department Crime Data CSV: https://data.austintexas.gov/Public-Safety/Crime-Reports/fdj4-gpfu
Austin Housing Market Analysis Data by Zip Code CSV: https://data.austintexas.gov/Housing-and-Real-Estate/2014-Housing-Market-Analysis-Data-by-Zip-Code/hcnj-rei3
Displacement Risk Demographics: See Data Resources file

For the mock-up, we were able to create an ERD database using the crime data csv file and Austin housing market csv file. We connected the two datasets by zipcode as the foreign key.
