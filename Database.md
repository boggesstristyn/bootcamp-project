### Database

For our final group project, we are analyzing crime rates in Austin while also looking at housing market trends and displacement risk. We have created a provisional database in csv file format that we sourced from the City of Austin open data portal. This database contains over 2.9 million rows of data. We also sourced the Austin housing market data (37 rows of data) and two displacement risk datasets also from the City of Austin open data portal (263 rows and 503 rows).

For the mock-up, we were able to create an ERD database using the crime data csv file and Austin housing market csv file. We connected the two datasets by zipcode as the foreign key.
