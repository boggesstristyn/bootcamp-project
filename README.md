# Austin Gentrification

## Topic

#### Cities grow and change, and citizens and businesses adapt to these changes. A concept for bringing new and refreshed life into a city can be called gentrification. More specifically, gentrification is the process of changing the character of a poor urban area through the influx of more well-off residents and upscale businesses. While gentrification can be seen as progress for some, the displacement of others can be negatively life altering.

#### As Austin, TX, experiences its own rapid growth and change, we can see families displaced and shifts in cultural comfort. Is there a correlation between gentrification and crime rates? Because we are mostly Austin locals, our group has decided to take an analytical look at gentrification and crime rates in these areas.

#### Are crime rates higher in areas with greater displacement risk?
- What is the relation between gentrification and crime?
- In regards to displacement risk, what is the most relevant demographic metric?
- Is it possible to predict if a population is vulnerable to gentrification or not?

## Dashboard

#### As our data contains latitude, longitude, and Census Tract identifiers, we want to utilize a map as the main component of our dashboard. The map will allow the user to select a Census Tract area from the map, where then summary demographic metrics and crime statistics for the selected Census Tract will be displayed under the map.
 
#### To create our dashboard, we will be utilizing Tableau. Tableau will connect to our database, then allow us to create visuals for our presentation slides and interactive dashboard. For the dashboard, we will first need to create three separate sheets, one map and two summary tables/graphs to then combine into the one dashboard. We will use our merged Displacement and Crime table for these visualizations.
 
#### To ensure that anyone who visits our dashboard understands the information presented in the visualizations, we will include our topic, definitions, model use and results, and dashboard purpose in a summary statement to the left of the interactive features. Below is a storyboard of what the dashboard would look like.

#### Dashboard outline can be found on our presentation [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-TiG67iIzo5gKKd23wOaXQg1TtN5CmG_sfSwT-wCHaw/edit#slide=id.p).
