# Gentrification v Crime

### Topic

Cities grow and change, and citizens and businesses adapt to these changes. A concept for bringing new and refreshed life into a city can be called gentrification. More specifically, gentrification is the process of changing the character of a poor urban area through the influx of more well-off residents and upscale businesses. While gentrification can be seen as progress for some, the displacement of others can be negatively life altering.


As Austin, TX, experiences its own rapid growth and change, we can see families displaced and shifts in cultural comfort. Is there a correlation between gentrification and crime rates? Because we are mostly Austin locals, our group has decided to take an analytical look at gentrification and crime rates in these areas.
