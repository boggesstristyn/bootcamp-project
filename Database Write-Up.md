# Database

During this phase of the project, created the databases using the three source csv files. You can find these in the Cleaning file.

1. crime_reports_cleaning.ipynb
2. displacement_risk_cleaning.ipynb
3. housing_cleaning.ipynb

Within each database we cleaned the columbs and checked the data types. After cleaning, we were able to create dataframes.
