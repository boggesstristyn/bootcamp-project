## Which model did you choose and why?
For this project, we are choosing a Random Forest Model. This will allow us to rank our choosen features by importance and determine if we need to perform further feature reduction. If our model finds multiple colinear features, we can perform PCA before running the Random Forest Model. In addition, we will also run GradientBoostedTree and XGBoost models and determine the most accurate prediction for our data.

## How are you training your model?
To train our model, we will test the remaining features to determine if any undersampling or oversampling will need to performed to our data before running our model. Depending on what kind of sampling is needed, we can adjust our model to use Logistic Regression or other distributions.
