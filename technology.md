## Machine Learning
 To create our machine learning algorithm, we intend to use Python and the NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.pylot libraries. 
 The benefits of making Python the perfect solution for machine learning and AI-driven projects include simplicity and consistency, flexibility, access to powerful AI
  and machine learning (ML) libraries and frameworks, platform independence, and large communities. We will use NumPy because NumPy is a library for the 
  Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. 
  Using SciPy will enable us to  perform powerful image manipulations that are often used in the preprocessing step of several Machine Learning applications.
  Using Scikit-learn will provide a wide selection of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. Finally using Matplotlib.pylot libaries because
   Matplotlib is a very popular Python library for data visualization.
